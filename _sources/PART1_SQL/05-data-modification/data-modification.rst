Modifying data
==============

This chapter will explain the basic mechanisms for adding data to tables, removing data from tables, and modifying data.

Tables used in this chapter
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

For this chapter, we will work with the tables **bookstore_inventory** and **bookstore_sales**, which simulate a simple database a seller of used books might use.  The **bookstore_inventory** table lists printed books that the bookstore either has in stock, or has sold recently, along with the condition of the book and the asking price.  The column **stock_number** is a unique identifier for each book.

When the bookstore sells a book, a record is added to the **bookstore_sales** table.  This table lists the **stock_number** of the book sold, the date sold, and the type of payment.  The column **receipt_number** is a unique identifier for the sale.  (This may not be a very good database design; it assumes we only sell one book at a time!)

A full description of these tables can be found in :ref:`Appendix A <appendix-a>`.

Adding data using INSERT
::::::::::::::::::::::::

To add rows to a table in the database, we use a statement starting with the keyword **INSERT**.  In its simplest form, **INSERT** lets you add a single row to a table by providing a value for each column in the table as defined.  As an example, suppose a customer at our bookstore purchases our copy of *One Hundred Years of Solitude* by Gabriel García Márquez.  This book is listed in our inventory with a stock number of 1455.  The customer purchases the book on August 14, 2021 and pays cash.  Finally, we provide a receipt to the customer with receipt number 970.

In the database, the table **bookstore_sales** is defined with the columns in this order:  **receipt_number**, **stock_number**, **date_sold**, and **payment**.

We could record the sale using this statement:

.. activecode:: data_modification_example_insert
    :language: sql
    :dburl: /_static/textbook.sqlite3

    INSERT INTO bookstore_sales
    VALUES (970, 1455, '2021-08-14', 'cash');

Try the above statement in the interactive tool, then use a **SELECT** query to verify that the new data has been added.


Specifying columns
------------------

Performing the insert as we did above works fine when we know for certain how a table has been defined in a database.  However, in practice tables change over time, which may result in columns appearing in a different order, or in more columns being added to the table.  If this happens, old SQL code that makes out of date assumptions about the table structure will break.  So it is a better practice to provide not only the data, but the columns in which we want to put the data.  To do this, we simply list the columns in parentheses after the table name:

::

    INSERT INTO bookstore_sales (receipt_number, stock_number, date_sold, payment)
    VALUES (971, 1429, '2021-08-15', 'trade in');

As described in :numref:`Chapter {number} <table-creation-chapter>`, it is possible to have some of our columns be automatically generated by the database.  For example, if we add a new book to our inventory, we want to generate a new, unique stock number.  The **bookstore_inventory** table is set up to do this.  When the database generates values like this for us, we should not provide a value for the generated column.  Specifying columns lets us insert data for all of the non-generated columns.

The **bookstore_sales** table is also set up to generate unique **receipt_number** values (above we provided values for the receipt number, which only works as long as the values we provide are not already used).  The **bookstore_sales** table also has a default setting for the **date_sold** column - it will put in today's date for you if you do not provide a value for the column.  Here is how the **bookstore_sales** table might be used in practice:

::

    INSERT INTO bookstore_sales (stock_number, payment)
    VALUES (1460, 'cash');

Inserting multiple rows
-----------------------

While it is perfectly valid to do multiple **INSERT** statements to add multiple rows of data, SQL also lets you provide multiple rows in a single **INSERT** statement.  Perhaps we wish to enter all of a day's sales in one statement:

::

    INSERT INTO bookstore_sales (stock_number, payment)
    VALUES
      (1444, 'credit card'),
      (1435, 'cash'),
      (1453, 'credit card')
    ;

(Note for Oracle users: Oracle does not permit multiple rows in an **INSERT**.)

Inserting query results
-----------------------

SQL also provides the capability of providing values via a **SELECT** query.  As a somewhat contrived example, suppose we create another table named **bookstore_recent_sales** with columns **author** and **title**; we will store data in this table about books we sold recently (perhaps to see what books and authors are popular, to inform our purchasing).  We might want to fill this table with the unique books that have been sold in the past month.

The syntax is the same as a regular **INSERT**, but with the **VALUES** clause replaced by a **SELECT** query (which must return columns of the same type and in the same order as the columns we are inserting into):

::

    CREATE TABLE bookstore_recent_sales (author TEXT, title TEXT);

    INSERT INTO bookstore_recent_sales (author, title)
    SELECT DISTINCT i.author, i.title
    FROM
      bookstore_inventory AS i
      JOIN bookstore_sales AS s ON s.stock_number = i.stock_number
    WHERE s.date_sold BETWEEN '2021-08-01' AND '2021-08-31';


Removing data with DELETE
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Removing rows from a table is accomplished using **DELETE** statements.  **DELETE** statements are generally very simple, requiring only a **FROM** clause and optionally a **WHERE** clause.  You can delete data from only one table at a time.  As an example, if we want to remove all sales from **bookstore_sales** prior to August 1, 2021, we could do:

.. activecode:: data_modification_example_delete
    :language: sql
    :dburl: /_static/textbook.sqlite3

    DELETE FROM bookstore_sales
    WHERE date_sold < '2021-08-01';

This is probably a bad idea unless we first delete the data from **bookstore_inventory** for the books we are deleting - otherwise we might think that we still have those sold books.  Since we cannot delete data from multiple tables in one query (e.g., using a join) it may be tricky to see how to get rid of the appropriate rows from **bookstore_inventory** - the information about what rows we want to delete is actually in **bookstore_sales** (in the **date_sold** column).  The technique we need will be covered in :numref:`Chapter {number} <subqueries-chapter>` - using a subquery.  Here is the necessary query, given without explanation for now:

::

    DELETE FROM bookstore_inventory
    WHERE stock_number IN
      (SELECT stock_number FROM bookstore_sales
       WHERE date_sold < '2021-08-01')
    ;

In :numref:`Chapter {number} <constraints-chapter>`) we will discuss other techniques for keeping multiple tables consistent with each other.

If the **WHERE** clause is omitted in a **DELETE** query, then all data from the table is removed.

As with any data modification statement, the effects of a **DELETE** statement are immediate and permanent (unless performed within a transaction: see chapter XXX).  To some extent, you can undo the result of an **INSERT** with a **DELETE** if you know which rows you inserted; however, it is impossible to restore deleted rows unless you have a backup of the data.  Thus it is very important to be sure you are deleting just what you want to delete.  A simple way to test before you perform a delete is to replace **DELETE** with **SELECT \*** in your statement - this will show you exactly the rows that you plan to delete.

Modifying data with UPDATE
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

One of the most powerful capabilities SQL provides is data modification using **UPDATE** statements.  The form of an **UPDATE** is:

::

    UPDATE tablename
    SET
      column1 = expression1,
      column2 = expression2,
      ...
    [WHERE expressions]
    ;

Often we may want to update a single row in our database.  For example, perhaps we examine one of the books in our bookstore inventory and decide that its condition is better than we initially thought.  Our copy of *Slow River* by Nicola Griffith (stock number 1460) is listed as in fair condition, with a price of 2 (in some unit of currency).  We want to upgrade the condition to "good", and raise the price to 2.50 at the same time:

.. activecode:: data_modification_example_update
    :language: sql
    :dburl: /_static/textbook.sqlite3

    UPDATE bookstore_inventory
    SET
      condition = 'good',
      price = 2.50
    WHERE stock_number = 1460;

We can also update multiple rows at a time.  Perhaps we mistakenly put in all sales for August 1, 2021 as July 31 instead.  We can fix these in one query:

::

    UPDATE bookstore_sales
    SET date_sold = '2021-08-01'
    WHERE date_sold = '2021-07-31';

Of course, this only works if none of the sales marked as July 31 were correct; we might have to be more clever with our **WHERE** clause if not.

The real power of **UPDATE**, though, comes in the fact that the right hand side of the assignments in the **SET** clause can be expressions, and these expressions are based on the row being updated.  Hence, we can do something like the following:

::

    UPDATE bookstore_inventory
    SET price = price + 0.25;

This would raise the price of every book by 0.25.

Other data modification statements
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

SQL provides some other data modification statement types, which may or may not be supported in your database.  **TRUNCATE TABLE** removes all rows from a table, and is typically faster than **DELETE** (but can only be used to remove *all* rows).  **MERGE** is a somewhat complex operation that combines inserts, updates, and deletes, allowing synchronization of a table with another table or join of tables.  Neither of these operations is strictly necessary, given that the same results can be accomplished with **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**.  We will not cover them further in this book.

Self-check exercises
::::::::::::::::::::

This section contains exercises on **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE**, using the **bookstore_inventory** and **bookstore_sales** tables. Keep in mind that the database we are using for these exercises is shared with the interactive examples above; so any changes you have applied in an interactive tool above are reflected in the database you use below.  If the results you get are not what you are expecting, you may need to reload this page in your browser to get a fresh copy of the database.
